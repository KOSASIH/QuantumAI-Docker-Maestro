## Dockerfile 

Sure! Here's the markdown code for a Dockerfile that sets up the environment for an AI/ML app with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn dependencies:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.8

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Set the entry point of the container
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
```

Make sure to place this Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. It starts with a Python 3.8 base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, and copies the `requirements.txt` file into the container. Then, it installs the required dependencies using `pip`. Finally, it copies the rest of the application code into the container and sets the entry point to `app.py`.

Remember to adjust the entry point (`app.py`) according to the main file of your AI/ML app.

# Trained Model

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate sample data for regression
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=10)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict the target variable for new data
new_data = np.array([[1.5]])
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
```

In this Python script, we first import the necessary libraries, including `numpy` for generating sample data and `LinearRegression` from `sklearn` for creating a linear regression model. We then use the `make_regression` function to generate a sample dataset with 100 samples and 1 feature.

Next, we create an instance of the `LinearRegression` model and fit it to the generated data using the `fit` method. This trains the model on the data and finds the best fit line.

Finally, we use the trained model to predict the target variable for new data. In this example, we predict the target variable for a new data point with a feature value of 1.5. The predicted value is printed to the console.

# Create App 

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # Get the uploaded file
        file = request.files["file"]

        # Read the uploaded file as a pandas DataFrame
        data = pd.read_csv(file)

        # Perform predictions using the trained model
        predictions = model.predict(data)

        # Convert the predictions to a list
        predictions = predictions.tolist()

        return render_template("result.html", predictions=predictions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>AI/ML App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Data</h1>
    <form action="/predict" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="file" accept=".csv" required>
        <input type="submit" value="Predict">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- templates/result.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>AI/ML App - Results</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Prediction</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for prediction in predictions %}
            <tr>
                <td>{{ prediction }}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to save the trained model as "model.pkl" in the same directory as the Flask app.
